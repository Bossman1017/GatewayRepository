  <h2 class="header-2">Taking A Tour Ride On Dealey Plaza</h2>
  <p>Dealey Plaza
For some people, the first thing that comes to mind when they think of Dallas is: That's the place JFK was shot. It's not the first thing we think of, but it's an important part of history that's worth exploring if you haven't done so already. Walk around Dealey Plaza and see where the former president was assassinated. When you're done, tour the Sixth Floor Museum -- which has numerous historical exhibits pertaining to the assassination.</p>
  <p>This activity is intended for anyone who is intrested in learning about historical events. Admission pricing ranges from $18(Adults),$16(Seniors),$14(Youth), and kids are free.</p>

  <h2>Take A Selfie With The Giant Eyeball</h2>
  <p>In Downtown Dallas, there's a giant 30-foot tall sculpture of an eyeball. It sounds basic, but everyone takes pictures with it/of it. It's unique material for your Instagram, to say the least; once you're done eyeing the eyeball, take a stroll along Downtown's Main Street and hit up a bar to take the edge off the weirdness you just took part in.</p>
  <p>This activity is intended for all ages with no cost to see at all.</p>

  <h2 class="header-2">See Where The Cowboys Practice, Eat, And Play...And Then Cheer Them On In Person</h2>
  <p>You don't have to be a fan of the Dallas Cowboys to enjoy a tour of their new state-of-the-art training facility called the Star in Frisco a.k.a. the Ford Center When you're finished there, walk around the rest of the entertainment district and shop and eat like the pros do.Some people (wrongly) hate them, some people love them, but no matter where you stand, watching the Cowboys play a home game at AT&T Stadium is something you'll never forget. If it's not a game day, you should still swing by the stadium for a tour that takes you through the dressing rooms and out onto the field.</p>
  <p>This activity is intended for those of sightseers and sports fanatics alike, very family fan oriented. Prices vary based on certain events.</p>
