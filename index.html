  <h1>Welcome to Dallas,Texas</h1>
  <p>While the Dallas metro area has long been known as the home of corporate giants like American Airlines and Bank of America, it is also becoming one of the best places to launch a startup. Perhaps that's due to the fact that more than 60% of the Dallas
    population are under working age-making it a virtual pot of gold for future tech talent.</p>
  <p>According to Forbes, fast-growing venture capital funded startups, a higher rate of job creation and comparatively lower real estate costs are backing up Dallas metropolitan as one of the top hi-tech cities in the country, and we could not agree more.
  <p>The lively Dallas-Fort Worth area is home to plenty of live music and sports attracting young professionals, while the outlying suburbs tend to appeal to young families. Both demographics are flooding the area. The population in 2005 was about 5.8 million<br>
    and today stands at more than 7.1 million. With the cost of living just slightly lower than the national average (1.1% lower) and affordable home prices, companies and IT pros of all ages are flocking to Dallas at breakneck speed.</p>
